The code for autoregressive components

from the data, and updated according to the data. All other features are
similar to @dynamic.

    This code implements the autoregressive component as a sub-class of
    dynamic. Different from the dynamic component, the features in the

    All other features are similar to @dynamic.

    The latent states of autoReg are aligned in the order of
    [today - degree, today - degree + 1, ..., today - 2, today - 1]. Thus,
    when fetching the latents from autoReg component, use this order to
    correctly align the coefficients.

    (TODO: change the implementation of autoReg, so that the component uses
     filteredObs as the feature instead of the observed data. To do this, we
     might need pass the dlm as a parameter to autoReg, so that autoReg can
     fetch the filtered observation on the fly)
